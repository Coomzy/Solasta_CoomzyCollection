# Solasta Coomzy's Collection
Mods I made for myself for Solasta, although I'm probably done with the game thought I'd share. Anyone is welcome to do anything they want with the code no permission/credit needed. I'd also say I never tested or really made anything for multiplayer although if I had to guess the only problematic things would be Auto Confirms, Skip Dialog, Time Speed.
 
## Homebrew
- **Remove 1 Spell Per Turn Restriction** - Normally you if you cast a non-cantrip spell you can't cast another non-cantrip that turn, this removes that restriction
- **Alternate Crit Rule (1 dice set max)** - This uses the crit homebrew where you max out the original dice and roll the new ones. So a 2d6 attack on a crit becomes 12 + 2d6 making all crits very powerful even on bad rolls.
- **Unlimited Interactions** - Normally you get 1 interaction per turn (usually for switching weapons) but this allows unlimited so you can switch weapons freely

###### Homebrew - Flanking
- **+2 rather than advantage** - Classic alternate to flanking advantage and gives +2 to hit instead
- **Can get bonus from other flankers** - This means if someone is being flanked other people can get the bonus as well, even if they are not flanking them themselves
- **Ranged attacks allowed** - This basically removes the melee weapon requirement for flanking, I didn't really test much with it on 

## Auto Confirms
The game prompts you unnecessarily a lot (well I feel that way) so I made it so it'd just auto confirm in a few places.
- **Auto Enter Loaded Level** - When you finish loading an area rather than the "Press any key to continue" it just goes into the level
- **Auto Exit Area** - When you reach a exit area trigger it just exits rather than asking you

## Character Move Speed
This changes characters move speed in/out of combat so people aren't so slow. Warning it does effect everyone so people around towns seems like they're panicking.
- **Out of combat multiplier** / **In combat multiplier**

## Skip Dialog
This just adds the Pause Menu "Skip" button to a keybind, 
- **Use Harded Coded Mouse Buttons** - This is bound to Mouse4 (mouse thumb button 2) otherwise will use the **Keybind** option. I did this because I wanted it on mouse buttons but the keybind doesn't support that.

## Time Speed
This changes the engines time speed so you can fast forward parts, it's on button hold
- **Use Harded Coded Mouse Buttons** - This is bound to Mouse3 (mouse thumb button 1) otherwise will use the **Keybind** option. I did this because I wanted it on mouse buttons but the keybind doesn't support that.
- **Multiplier** - How much does time change by?

## Wait For Hit/Death Anim
By default a hit/death anim will wait 10 seconds for a event before carrying on the game. I found that when playing as a monk from CE2 it would often wait around with the unarmed attack, might have been related to them being prone and stunned? Either way this changes the time it will wait for
- **New Wait For Time** Game Default 10s, Mod Default 3s

## Achievements
There are a bunch of achievement to use or kill with damage type 20 times, this reduces it to a single time  
- **Use/Kill X once rather than 20 times**

## Debug
My debugging options, only for flanking but it looks horrible and you need to restart the mod to turn it on/off
- **Flanking**
